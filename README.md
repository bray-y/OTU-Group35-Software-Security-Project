# Secure Purchase Order (SPO) System
Software and Computer Security
Group 35 - CRN 75327

## Overview
The **Secure Purchase Order (SPO) System** is a cryptographically secure workflow designed to protect the creation, approval, and verification of purchase orders within an organization.

The system applies modern security principles to ensure:
- Confidentiality of sensitive purchasing data
- Integrity of purchase order information
- Authentication of system participants
- Non-repudiation of approvals
- Protection against replay and tampering attacks

The system simulates a real-world enterprise approval process involving three roles:
- **Purchaser** – creates and signs purchase orders
- **Supervisor** – reviews and approves purchase orders
- **Purchasing Department** – verifies approved orders before processing

## Security Features
The system uses a hybrid cryptographic architecture combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

| Security Property  | Implementation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Authentication | RSA digital signatures |
| Confidentiality | AES-256 encryption |
| Integrity | SHA-256 hashing |
| Non-repudiation | RSA signed transactions |
| Replay attack prevention | timestamps + order ID tracking |
| Secure key exchange | RSA encrypted AES keys |
| Audit logging | transaction logs |

## System Architecture
The project is divided into modular components responsible for specific functionality.

## Installation
### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bray-y/OTU-Group35-Software-Security-Project.git
cd OTU-Group35-Software-Security-Project
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Run the System
### Step 1 – Generate RSA Keys
```bash
python generate_keys.py
```
This creates RSA pairs for:
- purchaser
- supervisor
- purchasing department
The keys are stored in the ```keys``` folder

### Step 2 - Create Purchase Order
```bash
python -m purchaser_client.create_order
```
- creates purchase order
- generates timestamp
- signs order
- encrypts order
- sends order to supervisor

### Step 3 - Supervisor Approval
```bash
python -m supervisor_service.approve_order
```
- decrypts purchase order
- verifies purchaser signature
- checks timestamp validity
- signs approved order
- encrypts order for purchasing department

### Step 4 - Final Verification
```bash
python -m purchasing_service.verify_order
```
- decrypts order
- verifies both signatures
- logs successful transaction

## Example Audit Log Entry
```bash
2026-04-05 20:15:10 | purchaser | created_order | 12345
2026-04-05 20:15:15 | supervisor | approved_order | 12345
2026-04-05 20:15:20 | purchasing | verified_order | 12345
```
Audit logs provide traceability for all system actions.
